                <p>
                    My name is Kaylee Tite, and I use They/Them pronouns. I have two cats named Marceline and Johnny Tsunami. I love to read, cook, and bake. On weekends, I enjoy riding my OneWheel in the park, especially on stormy days.

            <p>I am a very curious person. I love to spend my days researching anything and everything until I feel satisfied that I understand it.</p>

            <p>I love food! My go-to comfort foods are either <strong>toast and tea</strong> or <strong>spicy garlic tofu and vegetables on rice</strong>.</p>
